What’s Aerospace Department? What facilities does IITB Aero Department have? To satisfy all these doubts, AEA council conducted ‘Department Open House’. Different labs in Aero Department were open for all people. There were lab assistants explaining how all things work around to eager minds. The main purpose of this event was to encourage students to know the department, the research going around there. AEA council worked hard to serve this purpose.
